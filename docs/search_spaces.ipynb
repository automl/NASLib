This I explain later. `set_scope()` set the scope for the graph and if specified also for all child graphs as graphs can be nested. `set_input()` is used to route the input from the incoming edges at the node to the input node of the subgraph. E.g. in case of macro node 5, the input to its subgraph will come from macro node 3 and 4. This is also the order in which the input will be assigned to the input nodes of the subgraph. In case of macro node 3, the two inputs are defines as `[2, 2]`. This is a hacky way to dublicate the output of macro node 2 although there is only one edge. The input will be dublicated in that case."
